See [task-manager-server/README.md](https://github.com/amigo228/mustageTz/blob/master/task-manager-server/README.md) for full backend setup instructions.

### Database
You need PostgreSQL installed locally (install from [official site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)) or use Docker to quickly start.

### TODO: use C++ implementation of crypto functions , use or modify it? Maybe I should use AES as a good encryptor in big projects, so yeap it is in action.
